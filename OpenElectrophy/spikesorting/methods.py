"""
This module collects all methods in the framework.



Here a wish list of what we plan to implement:

  * Pouzat 2005 MCMC  "Efficient spike-sorting of multi-state neurons using
     inter-spike intervals information"
  * KTEO of Joo Choi T Kim
  * "A nonparametric Bayesian alternative to spike sorting" (Frank Wood )
  * "An online spike detection and spike classification algorithm
    capable of instantaneous resolution of overlapping spikes", F Franke
  * Waveform alignement that minimize variance
  * Automated spike sorting algorithm based on laplacian
    eigenmaps and k-means clustering (E Chah)
  * Spike sorting: Bayesian clustering of non-stationary data (Aharon Bar-Hillel a)
  *  "Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting" , Jan Gasthaus>>> The author release to us the code as open source!!!
  * Kalman filter mixture model for spike sorting of non-stationary data, Ana Calabrese 
  * "Unsupervised Spike Detection and Sorting with Wavelets and
    Superparamagnetic Clustering", R. Quian Quiroga
